MINIFMOD 1.1, Copyright Firelight Multimedia, 1999-2000.
--------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.1
--------------
- New volume ramping mixer
- 8k footprint instead of 8.5k
- MSVC 5.0 support added
- small harmonic noise removed from mixing routine = clearer sound.
- Added sample load callback, when the XM loader loads samples, it calls your callback and 
  you can fill in the data if you like (you might have a better compression algorithm)
- XM porta between instrument samples fixed.
- removed dependancy on stdlib func strncmp so you dont have to write your own if you are replacing C stdlib.

Version 1.0
--------------
- Only 8k footprint in exe after being compressed with UPX.  (maybe less if you dont call info functions)
- Statically linkable .lib.
- XM only
- Windows Multimedia Wave Out only.  (140ms latency)
- FPU Interpolating, volume ramping mixer only.
- Only the basic API functions needed to play and synchronize a mod.
- Tremolo has been disabled
- MSVC 6 only 
- No file routines, you have to supply your own using FSOUND_SetFile
 
Instructions
------------
- See MAIN.CPP for an example of how to use MINIFMOD.
- You MUST set file IO callbacks for FMOD to use.  This is a very flexible way to
  work, and saves having multiple file routines for file, memory or wad loading!
  Just rip the sample if you dont know what it is about, or get the full FMOD 3 API and
  read the documentation entries on the functions in the help file provided.
- There are no error codes.  All functions return true or false, and it should be obvious why they fail.
- FSOUND_Init will fail if no IO callbacks are set.
- Compile your exe with SIZE optimizations ON.
- Compress your exe with UPX.  It is the best exe packer around.  It is at http://www.nexus.hu/upx/
- Pass a callback function to FMUSIC_LoadSong or NULL.  This will allow you to get a 
  callback when each sample is loaded in a song.  Here you can then fill in the data for
  the sample yourself.  Note if you set callbacks, the samples are not loaded from file,
  and will be just silence if not filled in.
- If rewriting C standard libraries you need to supply pow() for fmod music playback routine.
